        "Aromatic compounds, such as benzene, have unique ring structures and exhibit special stability and reactivity properties, playing a significant role in organic synthesis and industry",
        "Functional groups are specific arrangements of atoms within organic molecules that determine their chemical properties and reactivity. Examples include hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (C=O), and amino (-NH2) groups.",
        "Organic compounds can be found in nature (natural products) or synthesized in laboratories (synthetic compounds). Both play crucial roles in fields like medicine, agriculture, and materials science.",
        "Organic chemistry includes the study of polymers, which are large molecules composed of repeating units called monomers. Polymers have diverse applications, from plastics and fibers to biological macromolecules like DNA and proteins.",
